# Order Processing API – Candidate Exercise

## Overview
This is a small ASP.NET Core Web API project used as a **code review and refactoring exercise**.

The code builds and runs successfully, but contains a number of **intentional issues** related to:
- SOLID principles
- Dependency injection
- Thread safety
- Error handling
- Testability

## Your Task
You are **not required to add new features**.

Instead, please:
1. Review the code as if it were submitted in a real project
2. Identify problems, bugs, and design smells
3. Refactor where appropriate
4. Be prepared to explain *why* you made each change

## What We’re Looking For
- Clean, readable code
- Appropriate use of interfaces and DI
- Understanding of SOLID principles
- Pragmatic decision-making (not over-engineering)
- Clear reasoning and communication

## Guidance
- There is no single “correct” solution
- Focus on changes that improve maintainability and correctness
- You may add small helper classes or interfaces if justified
- Unit tests are optional but welcomed

## Time Expectation
~60–90 minutes

Good luck!
